"""OpenLineage run-event parser as a lineage source.

Second concrete in the ``lineage`` family alongside ``DbtManifestReader``.
OpenLineage is an open standard whose run events are emitted as JSON; each
event names a ``job`` plus its ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` datasets. Inputs and
outputs are aggregated per ``run.runId`` across all events of that run, and a
dataset edge ``input -> output`` is derived per run (every input is upstream of
every output of the same run). This matters because standard emitters report
inputs on the START event and outputs on the COMPLETE event of the same run;
per-event pairing would see no edges at all. ``eventType`` is not consulted:
every event of a run contributes its inputs/outputs to the run-level union
regardless of START/RUNNING/COMPLETE/etc. Events missing a usable
``run.runId`` cannot be correlated and fall back to a per-event pairing of
their own inputs and outputs. The result is a dataset-level lineage graph we
walk from a starting ``asset_urn``. Like dbt, this is a static-artifact source
(stdlib JSON, no new dependency); it adds backend/pedigree variety on the
family's UPSTREAM / DOWNSTREAM / BOTH walk rather than a new family surface.

The fixture top level is an object ``{"events": [<run event>, ...]}`` (the
``load_json_fixture`` contract requires a dict at the top level; a bare event
array would be rejected). A present ``"events"`` value that is not a list is a
malformed artifact, not a malformed event, and raises the family's typed
``FixtureLoadError`` rather than leaking a raw ``TypeError`` from iteration.
Datasets are identified by their ``name`` field ONLY; ``namespace`` is carried
through into each row but does not participate in identity, so two datasets
with the same name in different namespaces are conflated into one graph node
that carries the first-seen namespace. This keying is load-bearing (the row
shape and ``asset_urn`` matching depend on it) and is a documented contract.

    ``upstream_map[ds]`` is the set of datasets ``ds`` was produced from

    ``ds`` (children). ``namespace_index`` records the first-seen namespace per
    dataset name. Inputs and outputs are aggregated per ``run.runId`` across
    all of that run's events (regardless of ``eventType``), then the cartesian
    ``input x output`` is taken per run: a standard emitter reports inputs on
    START and outputs on COMPLETE, so per-event pairing would derive no edges.
    Events without a usable ``run.runId`` (missing, or non-dict ``run``)
    cannot be correlated and defensively form their own per-event group.
    Malformed entries (non-dict event, non-list inputs/outputs) are skipped

    carries partial events, and one bad event should not abort the walk.
