# Single source of truth for the memory-scope key family. Drives both
# ``MEMORY_SCOPE_KEYS`` and the property-mapping entries below, so renaming
# or extending the scope happens in exactly one place.
#
# Note on consumers: the existing ``NetworkxMemoryReader`` narrows
# ``REQUIRED_KEYS`` to ``("memory_scope_user_id",)`` only — its JSON fixture
# is keyed by user_id and the other scope aliases would silently no-op. The
# canonical OR-group ``MEMORY_SCOPE_KEYS`` is reserved for future concretes
# (Mem0, Letta, Zep+Graphiti) whose backends honor the full scope; keeping
# the constant exported documents that contract for the family.
#
# Uniformity assumption: every scope key gets ``context=True`` and
# ``strict_validation=False``. The first scope key that needs a different
# pair (e.g. ``strict_validation=True`` for an enum scope) will force this
# tuple shape to grow — at that point switch to a per-key spec dict
# constant rather than threading more positional fields through.
