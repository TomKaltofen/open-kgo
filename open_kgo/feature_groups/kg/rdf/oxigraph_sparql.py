"""Concrete RDF/SPARQL connector backed by an in-memory ``pyoxigraph.Store``.

Second concrete in the ``rdf`` family alongside ``RdfLibSparqlReader``: parses
a Turtle/N-Triples/RDF-XML file at ``locator`` into an embedded oxigraph store
and runs SPARQL 1.1 queries against it. oxigraph is a different SPARQL engine
(Rust-backed) than rdflib, so this proves the family base generalises across
implementations; it does not unlock new family surface (oxigraph has no RDFS
inference and we return JSON-binding-shaped rows, so ``reasoning_profile`` and
``result_format`` stay narrowed exactly as on ``RdfLibSparqlReader``).

The query text comes from the Feature's options context under ``query_text``.
``result_limit`` is enforced by breaking out of solution iteration once the cap
is reached (short-circuit, not slice-at-end). SELECT results map to
JSON-binding-shaped dicts; CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE map to ``s``/``p``/``o`` triple
rows; ASK maps to a single ``{"boolean": ...}`` row.

Queries run with ``use_default_graph_as_union=True``: the loader accepts
quad-bearing serialisations (TriG / N-Quads / JSON-LD) whose triples land in
NAMED graphs, and oxigraph's default query semantics scope a pattern without a
``GRAPH`` clause to the default graph only, which would make every such triple
invisible to every SELECT. The union semantics treat the default graph as the
union of all graphs, matching rdflib's default-union behaviour so the two
backends agree on what a plain query sees.

Backend divergence (deliberate, additive): unlike the rdflib sibling, which
yields no rows for non-SELECT shapes (its ``asdict``-skip path), this reader
emits boolean/triple rows for ASK/CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE. oxigraph is the more
complete backend here; the richer output is documented rather than regressed.
