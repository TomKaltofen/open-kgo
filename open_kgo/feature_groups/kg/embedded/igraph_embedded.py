"""python-igraph-backed embedded graph reader.

Second concrete in the ``embedded`` family alongside ``NetworkxEmbeddedReader``:
loads a graph from a fixture file (.gml / .graphml) at ``locator`` via
python-igraph and runs the same family operations (``nodes`` / ``edges`` /
``neighbors``). Demonstrates that the embedded family base generalises across a
second in-memory graph library; no new family surface is unlocked (igraph,
like NetworkX, is an embedded in-process backend), so this is backend variety,
not a new contract branch.

The family-advertised ``edgelist`` format is deliberately NOT supported here
(see the ``SUPPORTED_VALUES`` narrowing note below): igraph's ``Read_Edgelist``
yields integer-indexed vertices with no name/label, whereas the NetworkX
sibling's ``nx.read_edgelist`` yields string node tokens, so the same file
would produce different row identities across the two embedded backends.

The vertex identity exposed in rows is the first present of ``name`` / ``label``
/ ``id``, falling back to the integer vertex index. The committed GML fixtures
carry a ``label`` per node, so rows key on the label (e.g. ``"alice"``), which
mirrors what ``nx.read_gml`` produces (it relabels nodes to their ``label``).
