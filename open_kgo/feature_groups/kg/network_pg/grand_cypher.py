"""GrandCypher-backed embedded Cypher reader.

Second concrete in the ``network_pg`` family alongside ``KuzuCypherReader``:
runs openCypher queries against an in-memory NetworkX graph via the pure-Python
``grand-cypher`` library. Kuzu is an embedded C++ engine; GrandCypher is a
Python Cypher interpreter over NetworkX, so the two share the family's
Cypher-shaped contract on different substrates. Like Kuzu, this backend is
single-process and embedded, so ``read_consistency`` / ``transaction_mode``
are no-ops (waived, not narrowed: real network_pg backends will honor them).

The graph is loaded from a GML / GraphML file at ``locator`` (NetworkX relabels
GML nodes to their ``label``, keeping other attributes such as ``name``). The
Cypher text comes from the Feature's options context under ``query_text``.
GrandCypher returns a columnar ``{column: [values...]}`` dict, which we pivot
into the family's row-oriented ``list[dict]`` shape, capped at ``result_limit``.

Label mapping: grand-cypher resolves ``[:TYPE]`` and ``(n:Label)`` patterns
against a ``__labels__`` set attribute that ``nx.read_gml`` / ``nx.read_graphml``
never produce, so without an explicit mapping every typed pattern silently
returns zero rows. After loading, this reader therefore maps (see
``_apply_grand_labels``):

- the edge ``label`` attribute (present in GML fixtures such as ``org.gml``)
  to ``__labels__`` on each edge, so ``[:MANAGES]`` matches; and
- the node ``type`` attribute to ``__labels__`` on each node, so ``(p:Person)``
  matches when the source file carries one.

Node-label limitation: the committed ``org.gml`` fixture carries NO node
``type`` attribute (its GML node ``label`` is consumed by ``nx.read_gml`` as
the node id), so node-label filters match nothing against the committed
fixtures. Only a per-node ``type`` attribute is honored as the node label
source; other attribute names (``labels``, ``category``, ...) are NOT
consulted.

Engine quirks (grand-cypher 1.0.x, pinned here so callers are not surprised):

- A bare ``RETURN n`` yields a column keyed by a ``lark.Token`` (a ``str``
  subclass), with whole node-attribute dicts as values (including the
  injected ``__labels__`` set).
- Aggregations return nested per-alias dicts rather than flat scalars, e.g.
  ``RETURN COUNT(n)`` produces ``{'COUNT(n)': [{'e': 3, 'a': 3}]}``.
