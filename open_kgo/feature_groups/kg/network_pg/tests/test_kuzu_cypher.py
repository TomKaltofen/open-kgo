"""Concrete tests for KuzuCypherReader.

Builds a small Kuzu database in a temp dir during setup_method, runs Cypher
queries against it, and asserts on the row shape.

DESIGN NOTE (building the backend at test time is intentional, issue #20):
kuzu_cypher is the only connector that constructs its backend in setup rather
than reading a committed fixture, and that is a recorded decision, not an open
follow-up. Two parts:

1. Runtime build vs committed fixture: Kuzu's on-disk store is a binary,
   version-coupled format, so a checked-in ``.kuzu`` database could fail to open
   after a ``kuzu`` version bump. ``kuzu`` is subject to the default
   ``exclude-newer`` 7-day window (it is not in the longer ``exclude-newer-package``
   pin, which covers only the mloda packages), so it upgrades after that window
   rather than being held forever. Building a tiny three-node database at test
   time is version-agnostic and cheap. The sibling concrete ``grand_cypher`` reads
   a committed ``.gml`` text fixture, so the network_pg family already demonstrates
   both shapes (static text fixture and built backend).
2. Fresh temp path per test (not a shared, seed-once database): a shared
   seed-once database is technically viable. The reader caches ``kuzu.Database``
   process-wide keyed by absolute path (see ``kg.fixtures.load_kuzu_database``),
   and ``kg/conftest.py`` clears that cache around every test, so cache staleness
   across a reused path is already neutralised: under CPython the ``cache_clear``
   drops the only reference and the native handle (with its directory lock) is
   finalised before the next open. We keep the per-test rebuild simply because it
   is the most obviously isolated option and the cost is immaterial (a three-node
   seed; the network_pg suite runs in a couple of seconds), so collapsing it to a
   shared database would trade clarity for no measurable gain. A unique
   ``mkdtemp`` path is also incidentally robust against delayed finalisation on a
   non-refcounting interpreter, but that is not the reason for the choice.

PROTOTYPE NOTE: this exercises the network_pg property layout against a real
Cypher engine but does NOT exercise read_consistency / transaction_mode
semantics (Kuzu is embedded; these properties are no-ops here).
