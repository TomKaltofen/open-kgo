"""SPDX SBOM parser as a code_build source, walking the dependency graph.

Second concrete in the ``code_build`` family alongside ``CycloneDxSbomReader``.
SPDX is the other major SBOM standard; its JSON form carries ``packages`` and a
``relationships`` array whose ``DEPENDS_ON`` / ``DEPENDENCY_OF`` edges form a
real dependency graph. Where the CycloneDX concrete returns a flat component
list and strips every traversal key, this concrete *honors* the family's
``TraversalMixin`` per-call keys (``lineage_direction``, ``upstream_depth``,
``downstream_depth``) by BFS-walking that graph from a starting package. It is
the family's proof that the declared traversal surface is real, not decorative.

Parsed with stdlib JSON (no new dependency), mirroring the CycloneDX concrete.
The start package is named by a concrete-local ``start_spdx_id`` per-call param
(the code_build family base has no start-node key, unlike lineage's
``asset_urn``); the family-level entity-filter keys (``entity_type``,
``relationship_type``, ``expand_paths``) are dropped and rejected per-call.
