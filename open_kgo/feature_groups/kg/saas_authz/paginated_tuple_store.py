"""In-process tuple store that paginates results and expands group usersets.

Second concrete in the ``saas_authz`` family alongside
``InProcessTupleStoreReader`` (single-page, no expansion). This reader *honors*
the family surface the first concrete pins off: cursor pagination
(``pagination_style=cursor`` + ``page_size`` + per-call ``cursor_token``) and
``expand_paths`` (single-pass structural group expansion). It is the family's
proof that the pagination + expand contract is real.

HONESTY NOTE: like the first concrete, this is a shape-only fake. It does NOT
implement real Zanzibar consistency tokens, model-id versioning, or namespaced
check evaluation; ``consistency_mode`` is accepted but not honored (waived). The
expansion is a single structural pass: a tuple whose user is a userset
reference (``group:<id>#<rel>``) is replaced by the members of that group when
``<rel>`` is listed in ``expand_paths``.

CURSOR HONESTY NOTE: ``pagination_style=cursor`` is documented family-wide
(``PaginationMixin``) as an opaque server-returned cursor sent back on the
next request. This reader never returns a cursor: ``load_data`` returns only
rows, and callers fabricate positional ``offset:<N>`` tokens themselves
(decoded by ``parse_offset_cursor``). The tokens are positional offsets over
the re-sorted expanded tuple list, so if the fixture (or its expansion)
changes between pages, a saved token silently shifts to different rows; there
is no snapshot consistency behind the token.

The tuples are loaded from a JSON fixture at ``locator`` (shape:
``{tenant: [[object_type, object_id, relation, user], ...]}``). An unknown
tenant raises ``UnknownTenantError`` at connect time (the agent_memory
``UnknownMemoryScopeError`` precedent), so ``tenant`` stays open (non-strict)
rather than pinned to a closed enum.

    The membership index is built from ``all_tuples`` (not the filtered
    ``rows``) so group-membership tuples removed by an ``entity_type`` /
    ``relationship_type`` filter are still available to resolve a userset.
    Only usersets whose ``<rel>`` is listed in ``expand_paths`` are expanded;
    everything else passes through unchanged.

    Structural-expansion semantics: an expanded userset that resolves to no
    members (an empty or absent group) yields **zero** grants — the original
    ``group:<id>#<rel>`` row is replaced by its (empty) membership, so it drops
    out of the result. A userset whose ``<rel>`` is NOT in ``expand_paths`` is
    left untouched and passes through as-is.

    Single-pass semantics (a deliberate divergence from Zanzibar's recursive
    Expand): the membership index is consulted exactly once per input row, so
    expansion *output* is never re-expanded. Two consequences callers must
    know about:

    - A nested userset passes through unexpanded EVEN IF its ``<rel>`` is in
      ``expand_paths``: when ``group:eng#member`` contains
      ``group:sub#member`` as a member, expanding the eng row emits the
      ``group:sub#member`` reference itself, not sub's members.
    - A self-referential userset (``group:eng#member`` listing itself as a
      member) terminates trivially by emitting itself; there is no recursion
      to cycle through.
